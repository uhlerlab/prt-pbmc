Randomized plate layouts can be generated with the plate layout [randomization script](../scripts/randomize.sh).
Final plate layouts are provided separately with the dataset and do not all correspond to the output of the
current version of the script, as we needed to make some modifications along the way, e.g., due to missing and 
low cell count samples.
