# Figure notebooks

The figure notebooks contain the code for reproducing the main and supplementary figures
from the paper. They require models and pre-processed data created using the notebooks in the
[`notebooks`](../notebooks) folder. The notebooks are named after the corresponding main and 
supplementary figures they contain code for.
